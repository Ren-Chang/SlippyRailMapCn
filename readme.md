# About
This is a slippy map of railway lines and stations in China, using base map tiles kindly provided by [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com/attributions) with [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) data. It's still in its test phase, so not all the attributes are symbolized and only 0-9 levels of rail layer can be seen for now. Legends panel and alternative terrain layer will be added in the near future. 

The railway data credit goes to [@贵广十标段](http://weibo.com/u/3513941704), a rail fan who edited spatial data from earlier enthusiasts and added attribute data by himself. There is no guarentee on its correctness, however you can inform us of any errors about data by emailing renchang1028(at)163(dot)com.

The railway tiles are rendered using [Mapnik](http://github.com/mapnik/mapnik) and OpenStreetMap [generate_tiles.py](http://svn.openstreetmap.org/applications/rendering/mapnik/generate_tiles.py), with my customized version XML stylesheet.
